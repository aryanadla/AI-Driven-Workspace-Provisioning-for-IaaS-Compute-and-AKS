Version 2 Overview:
In Version 2 of our project, we developed a user interface for managing virtual machines, enhancing user interaction with four key buttons: Submit, Destroy, Monitor, and Download PEM.

Submit Button: Automates the provisioning of a virtual machine in Azure.
Destroy Button: Deletes the specified virtual machine resource.
Monitor Button: Opens a new page that displays real-time metrics for the virtual machine. After clicking this button, wait a moment for the metrics to be fetched.
Download PEM Button: Facilitates the download of the secret key in PEM format.
Additionally, we implemented the endpoint http://localhost:5000/monitor, which continuously retrieves metrics from the Azure REST API at the following URL:

perl
Copy code
https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/{VM_name}/providers/microsoft.insights/metrics?api-version=2018-01-01&metricnames=Percentage%20CPU,Available%20Memory%20Bytes,Network%20In%20Total,Network%20Out%20Total&timespan=PT1H&aggregation=Average&interval=PT1H
This endpoint fetches metrics such as CPU usage, available memory, and network activity.

To ensure seamless access to the metrics API, we implemented an automatic token generation mechanism using the following endpoint for acquiring the access token:

bash
Copy code
https://login.microsoftonline.com/{subscriptionId}/oauth2/v2.0/token
Whenever the token expires, a new token is generated automatically to maintain continuous access.

We introduced two static HTML files:

index.html: Serves as the home page for user input.
monitor.html: Displays the fetched metrics on-screen, updating every 20 seconds.
Finally, we added the functionality to download the PEM file via the Download PEM button.

With these enhancements, users can easily manage virtual machines, monitor their performance, and download necessary credentials, all from a streamlined interface.
