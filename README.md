# Introduction 
This project aims to automate the provisioning of Azure VMs, Databricks Clusters, and AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service) using a DevSecOps pipeline. Leveraging AI, it optimizes workload distribution and enforces security policies during infrastructure setup. The project includes a user-friendly interface to manage and monitor the provisioning process.

# Getting Started
Installation Process
Clone the repository.
Install dependencies:
Terraform
Kubernetes
Azure CLI
Python (with necessary libraries)
Software Dependencies
Azure VM, Databricks Cluster, AKS
Terraform for Infrastructure as Code

Latest Releases
The latest version automates the provisioning of resources and includes AI-driven workload optimization and security enforcement.

API References
/api/v1/provision - Triggers the provisioning of resources.
/api/v1/validate - Validates infrastructure with AI for optimization and security compliance.
/api/v1/monitor - Retrieves real-time monitoring status.

# Build and Test
Build
Use Terraform scripts to define and provision infrastructure.
Use Angular to build the user interface (npm install and npm run build).
Testing
Unit Testing: Test individual microservices (e.g., provisioning, validation) to ensure functionality.
Integration Testing: Verify seamless interaction between components like VMs, Databricks, and AKS.
Load Testing: Test high-load scenarios by provisioning multiple resources concurrently.
Security Testing: Ensure infrastructure complies with AI-driven security policies and passes penetration testing. 

# Contribute
Contributions are welcome to improve the AI optimization, UI, and security features. To contribute:
